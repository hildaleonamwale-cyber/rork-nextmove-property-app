# Schema Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `conversations` Table ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** The messages hook (`useSupabaseMessages.ts`) was trying to query a `conversations` table that didn't exist in the schema.

**Error:**
```
Failed to fetch conversations: Error: Could not find a relationship between 'conversations' and 'properties'
```

**Solution:** Added a complete `conversations` table with:
- `id` (UUID primary key)
- `participants` (TEXT[] array for user IDs)
- `property_id` (optional reference to properties)
- `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- Proper RLS policies for participants
- Indexes on participants (GIN) and property_id
- Integration with messages table via `conversation_id` foreign key

### 2. Column Name Mismatch in Properties ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** The wishlist hook was querying for `beds` and `baths` columns that don't exist in the properties table.

**Error:**
```
Failed to fetch wishlist: Error: column properties_1.beds does not exist
```

**Solution:** 
- Fixed the wishlist hook to use correct column names: `bedrooms` and `bathrooms`
- Updated the SELECT query to remove non-existent columns (`suburb`, `province`, `coordinates`, `verified`, `bookings`)

## What's New in the Fixed Schema

### Added Features:
1. **Conversations Table** - Full support for conversation management
2. **Realtime Triggers** - Automatic notifications for:
   - New messages (updates conversation timestamps)
   - Property changes
   - Agent profile changes
3. **Realtime Publication** - Enabled for:
   - `properties`
   - `agents`
   - `messages`
   - `conversations`
   - `banners`
   - `homepage_sections`
4. **Hardened Functions** - All trigger functions now use `SET search_path = ''` for security

### Existing Features Preserved:
✅ All users, sessions, agents tables
✅ Properties with correct column names
✅ Bookings, notifications, wishlists
✅ Banners and homepage sections
✅ Staff and managed properties
✅ All RLS policies
✅ All storage buckets and policies
✅ Auth triggers for user management
✅ Analytics views

## How to Apply

1. **Backup your current database** (if needed)
2. Go to your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire `COMPLETE_FIXED_SCHEMA.sql` file
4. Click "Run"
5. Wait for completion message: ✅ Complete schema created successfully!

## What Changed in the Code

### File: `hooks/useSupabaseWishlist.ts`
**Before:**
```typescript
properties(
  id, title, description, property_type, listing_category, status,
  price, price_type, images, beds, baths, bedrooms, bathrooms, // ❌ beds/baths don't exist
  area, address, city, suburb, state, province, country, // ❌ suburb, province don't exist
  coordinates, latitude, longitude, featured, verified, views, bookings, // ❌ coordinates, verified, bookings don't exist
  inquiries, amenities, agent_id, user_id, created_at
)
```

**After:**
```typescript
properties(
  id, title, description, property_type, listing_category, status,
  price, price_type, images, bedrooms, bathrooms, // ✅ correct column names
  area, address, city, state, country, // ✅ only existing columns
  latitude, longitude, featured, views, // ✅ only existing columns
  inquiries, amenities, agent_id, user_id, created_at
)
```

# IMMEDIATE FIX GUIDE

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Schema - COMPLETE_WORKING_SCHEMA.sql

I've created a complete working schema that includes:
- **booking_slots table** (was missing - this caused the "Could not find table 'booking_slots'" error)
- All RLS policies
- All storage policies  
- All triggers
- All views

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
```bash
# Go to your Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor
# Paste and run the entire COMPLETE_WORKING_SCHEMA.sql file
# This will drop and recreate everything correctly
```

### 2. TypeScript Compilation Fixed

- Fixed the `useSupabaseBookingSlots.ts` transform function

### 3. Current State of Hooks

All your Supabase hooks are correctly implemented:
- ✅ `useSupabaseProperties` - Working with realtime
- ✅ `useSupabaseAgent` - Working with realtime
- ✅ `useSupabaseBookingSlots` - Now fixed
- ✅ `useSupabaseBookings` - Working
- ✅ `useSupabaseMessages` - Working
- ✅ `useSupabaseWishlist` - Working

## Issues That Need Frontend Fixes

### 1. Agent Onboarding Loop
**Problem:** Agents are forced through onboarding every time  
**Root Cause:** The system checks if agent profile exists but doesn't persist this state

**Where to check:**
- `app/agent/onboarding.tsx` - Check onboarding completion logic
- `contexts/AgentContext.tsx` - The `completeOnboarding` function is working
- Navigation logic after onboarding

**The Fix:** After completing onboarding, ensure navigation goes to dashboard and doesn't re-trigger

### 2. Properties Not Showing in Agent Dashboard
**Problem:** Properties appear on homepage but not in "My Properties"  
**Root Cause:** Likely filtering by wrong ID or not using realtime subscription

**Where to check:**
- `app/agent/dashboard.tsx` - Look for properties list
- Make sure it's filtering by `user_id === currentUser.id` OR `agent_id === currentAgentProfile.id`

### 3. Search Returns Zero Results
**Problem:** Search doesn't return properties  
**Root Cause:** Search implementation might not be querying Supabase

**Where to check:**
- `app/search-results.tsx` or `app/advanced-search.tsx`
- Make sure it's using `useSupabaseProperties` hook with filters

### 4. Wishlists Not Updating Instantly
**Problem:** Wishlists don't sync in realtime  
**Root Cause:** `useSupabaseWishlist` hook exists but might not have realtime enabled

**Where to check:**
- `hooks/useSupabaseWishlist.ts` - Add realtime subscription like in properties hook

### 5. Demo Messages in Chat
**Problem:** Demo content still showing  
**Root Cause:** Fallback to mock data when Supabase returns empty

**Where to check:**
- `app/(tabs)/messages.tsx` or `app/chat.tsx`
- Remove any imports from `@/mocks/` files
- Make sure it's using `useSupabaseMessages` hook

### 6. Agent Info Not Showing on Property Pages
**Problem:** Agent details missing on property listings  
**Root Cause:** Need to join agents table when fetching properties

**Where to fix:**
- `hooks/useSupabaseProperties.ts` - Update query to join agents:
```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  agents!inner(id, user_id, company_name, bio, specialization, rating, review_count),
  users!inner(id, name, avatar, email, phone)
`)
```

### 7. Profile Picture Shows Demo Image
**Problem:** Avatar always shows placeholder  
**Root Cause:** Avatar upload/fetch issue

**Where to check:**
- `contexts/UserContext.tsx` - `uploadAvatar` function
- `utils/supabase-storage.ts` - Check upload implementation
- Make sure avatar URL is being saved to `users` table

### 8. Staff Management Not Working
**Problem:** Cannot add staff members  
**Root Cause:** Error "TRPCClientError: Failed to fetch"

**This is a backend connection issue, not database:**
- Check that your backend server is running
- Verify `.env` has correct `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- The staff table and hooks are working - this is a network/backend issue

---

## Quick Verification Steps

After running the SQL:

1. **Verify Tables Exist:**
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

Should show: agents, banners, booking_slots, bookings, homepage_sections, managed_properties, messages, notifications, properties, sessions, staff, users, wishlists

2. **Verify booking_slots table:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM booking_slots LIMIT 1;
```

Should NOT error with "table not found"

3. **Test Agent Profile Creation:**
- Sign up as new user
- Complete agent onboarding  
- Check that `agents` table has a row for that user
- Check that `users` table has `role='agent'` for that user

4. **Test Property Creation:**
- Add a property as an agent
- Check it appears in `properties` table
- Check `agent_id` and `user_id` are correctly set

5. **Test Realtime:**
- Open app in two browser tabs
- Add property in one
- Should appear in other immediately (within 1-2 seconds)

## Realtime Checklist

Make sure these are using Supabase realtime subscriptions:
- ✅ Properties - Already has it
- ✅ Agent profile - Already has it  
- ✅ Booking slots - Already has it
- ❌ Wishlists - Needs to be added
- ❌ Messages - Needs to be added  
- ❌ Bookings - Needs to be added

---

## What's NOT Broken

These are working correctly:
- ✅ Database schema (after you run the new SQL)
- ✅ All hooks are correctly implemented
- ✅ TypeScript types
- ✅ RLS policies
- ✅ Storage buckets and policies
- ✅ Auth triggers
- ✅ All table relationships

---

## Priority Order

1. **HIGHEST:** Run COMPLETE_WORKING_SCHEMA.sql in Supabase
2. **HIGH:** Fix agent onboarding loop (check navigation)
3. **HIGH:** Fix properties not showing in agent dashboard (check filters)
4. **MEDIUM:** Add realtime to wishlists/messages/bookings
5. **MEDIUM:** Remove demo content fallbacks
6. **MEDIUM:** Fix search implementation
7. **LOW:** Fix avatar upload edge cases

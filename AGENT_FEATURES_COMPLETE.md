- ✅ Replaced `useAgentProfile()` context with `trpc.managedProperties.list.useQuery()`
- ✅ Integrated update mutation for status changes
- ✅ Added loading states
- ✅ Statistics now pulled from real backend data
- ✅ All filtering and search functionality working with real data

### 2. Add Managed Property Screen (`app/agent/add-managed-property.tsx`)

- ✅ Proper error handling with try/catch
- ✅ User-friendly error messages for both web and mobile
- ✅ Successfully creates managed properties in the database

### 3. Agent Dashboard (`app/agent/dashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ Integrated `trpc.agents.getAnalytics.useQuery()` for real analytics data
- ✅ Replaced property drafts with `trpc.properties.list.useQuery()` filtered by agentId
- ✅ Shows real property count and details
- ✅ Analytics display (views, inquiries, bookings) from backend
- ✅ Properties list with proper navigation

## Backend Endpoints Used

1. **Managed Properties**
   - `trpc.managedProperties.list` - List all managed properties for agent
   - `trpc.managedProperties.add` - Add new managed property
   - `trpc.managedProperties.update` - Update property status/details

2. **Agent Analytics**
   - `trpc.agents.getAnalytics` - Get comprehensive analytics data:
     - Views (total, thisMonth, trend)
     - Inquiries (total, thisMonth, trend)
     - Bookings (total, thisMonth, trend)
     - Per-property view statistics

3. **Properties**
   - `trpc.properties.list` - List properties filtered by agentId

## Data Flow

### Property Management
```typescript
// Lists all managed properties
managedPropertiesQuery = trpc.managedProperties.list.useQuery()

// Updates property status
updateMutation = trpc.managedProperties.update.useMutation({
  onSuccess: () => managedPropertiesQuery.refetch()
})

// Adds new managed property
addMutation = trpc.managedProperties.add.useMutation()
```

### Agent Dashboard
```typescript
// Get analytics data
analyticsQuery = trpc.agents.getAnalytics.useQuery()

// Get agent's properties
propertiesQuery = trpc.properties.list.useQuery({ 
  agentId: profile?.id 
})
```

# Search Integration Complete

## Overview
Advanced search and search results have been successfully integrated with backend endpoints.

## What Was Done

### 1. Search Results Page (`app/search-results.tsx`)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

#### Changes Made:
- Replaced mock data with `trpc.properties.list.useQuery()`
- Properly maps all advanced search parameters to backend API format:
  - `listingCategory` → property, stand, room, commercial
  - `transactionType` → mapped to status (For Rent / For Sale)
  - `priceMin` & `priceMax` → number conversion
  - `bedrooms` & `bathrooms` → number conversion
  - `city` / `province` → mapped to `location` parameter
- Added loading state
- Added proper memoization for performance
- Dynamic location label display
- Client-side filtering for quick filter chips

#### Features:
- Real-time search results from database
- Supports all property types (property, stand, room, commercial)
- Price range filtering
- Bedroom/bathroom filtering
- Location-based search
- Transaction type filtering

### 2. Advanced Search Page (`app/advanced-search.tsx`)
**Status:** ✅ Already Complete

#### Features:
- Listing type selection (Property, Stand, Room, Commercial)
- Transaction type (Rent/Buy)
- Province & City selection
- Property type selection (Full House, Cottage, etc.)
- Price range inputs
- Bedroom/bathroom selection
- Facility filters (Pool, Garage, Bath)
- Reset functionality
- All parameters properly passed to search results page

### 3. Home Page (`app/(tabs)/home.tsx`)
**Status:** ✅ Already Integrated

#### Features:
- Uses `trpc.properties.list.useQuery()` for regular properties
- Separate query for featured properties
- Search with location suggestions
- Falls back to mock data if no backend data available
- Advanced search button
- Location-based quick search

### 4. Property Details (`app/property/[id].tsx`)
**Status:** ✅ Already Integrated

#### Features:
- Uses `trpc.properties.get.useQuery()` for property data
- Automatic view count increment via `trpc.properties.incrementViews.useMutation()`
- Falls back to mock data if property not found
- Supports all property types

## Backend Endpoints Used

### Properties List
```typescript
trpc.properties.list.useQuery({
  listingCategory?: "property" | "stand" | "room" | "commercial",
  status?: ("For Rent" | "For Sale" | "Internal Management")[],
  priceMin?: number,
  priceMax?: number,
  bedrooms?: number,
  bathrooms?: number,
  location?: string,
  featured?: boolean,
  limit?: number,
  offset?: number,
})
```

### Property Details
```typescript
trpc.properties.get.useQuery({ id: string })
```

### View Count
```typescript
trpc.properties.incrementViews.useMutation()
```

## Search Flow

1. **User enters search from home page:**
   - Enters location/query in search bar
   - System shows location suggestions
   - User submits → redirects to search-results with `query` and `city` params

2. **User uses advanced search:**
   - Selects filters (listing type, transaction, price, location, etc.)
   - Clicks Search button
   - Redirects to search-results with all filter params

3. **Search results page:**
   - Converts all params to backend query format
   - Fetches data from backend via tRPC
   - Displays loading state
   - Shows filtered results
   - Supports additional client-side filtering via chips
   - Each property card links to property details

4. **Property details:**
   - Fetches individual property data
   - Increments view count
   - Displays all property information
   - Allows booking, messaging, etc.

## Testing Instructions

### Test Advanced Search:
1. Open app and navigate to home
2. Click "Advanced Search" button
3. Select filters:
   - Listing Type: Property
   - Transaction: Rent
   - Location: Harare
   - Price: $100 - $1000
   - Bedrooms: 2
4. Click Search
5. Should see properties matching criteria

### Test Quick Search:
1. On home page, type "Harare" in search box
2. Select from suggestions or press Enter
3. Should see all properties in Harare

### Test Property Details:
1. Click any property card
2. Should load property details
3. View count should increment

## Next Steps

Search functionality is now fully integrated! Other areas that may still need work:

1. **Wishlist** - Needs backend persistence
2. **Chat/Messages** - Real-time messaging integration
3. **Bookings** - Connect frontend booking flow to backend
4. **Notifications** - Real notification system
5. **User Profile** - Complete user management

## Notes

- All search parameters are properly typed and validated
- Pagination support is built-in (via limit/offset)
- Fallback to mock data ensures app works during development
- Location search uses fuzzy matching (LIKE query in backend)
- All property types (property, stand, room, commercial) are supported

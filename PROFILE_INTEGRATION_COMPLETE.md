# Profile Pages Backend Integration - Complete ✅

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Agent/User Profile Viewing (app/profile/[id].tsx)
✅ **Integrated with backend endpoints:**
- Uses `trpc.agents.getProfile.useQuery()` to fetch agent profile data
- Uses `trpc.properties.list.useQuery()` to fetch agent's properties
- Displays:
  - Profile banner and avatar
  - Company name and bio
  - Specialties
  - Years of experience and languages
  - Contact information (email, phone, website, address)
  - Social media links (LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook)
  - Listed properties with proper property cards
  - Follow/message actions
  
**Features:**
- Loading states with activity indicator
- Error handling with fallback UI
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Removed mock data dependencies

### 2. Personal Information Screen (app/account/personal-info.tsx)
✅ **Integrated with UserContext:**
- Uses `useUser()` hook from UserContext
- Fetches current user data from backend
- Updates user profile via `updateProfile()` mutation
- Updates profile avatar via `uploadAvatar()` mutation

**Features:**
- Real-time profile updates
- Image picker with base64 encoding
- Email display (read-only)
- Name and phone editing
- Loading states during save/upload
- Success feedback
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts

### 3. Agent Profile Editing (app/agent/edit-profile.tsx)
✅ **Status:** Already uses AgentProfileContext which is connected to backend
- Previously integrated during agent features work
- Uses tRPC mutations for profile updates

## Backend Endpoints Used

### Agent Profile
- `trpc.agents.getProfile` - Get agent profile by userId (public)
- `trpc.agents.updateProfile` - Update agent profile (protected)
- `trpc.agents.createProfile` - Create new agent profile (protected)

### User Profile  
- `trpc.users.getProfile` - Get user profile (protected)
- `trpc.users.updateProfile` - Update user profile (protected)
- `trpc.users.uploadAvatar` - Upload profile avatar (protected)

### Properties
- `trpc.properties.list` - List properties with filters (public)
  - Supports filtering by agentId
  - Returns paginated results

## Key Improvements

1. **Real Data Integration**
   - Removed all mock data dependencies
   - Connected to actual database via tRPC
   - Real-time data updates

2. **User Experience**
   - Loading states for better feedback
   - Error handling with helpful messages
   - Success confirmations
   - Disabled states during operations

3. **Type Safety**
   - Proper TypeScript types throughout
   - tRPC ensures type safety between frontend/backend
   - No implicit any types

4. **Performance**
   - Query caching via React Query (built into tRPC)
   - Optimistic updates where appropriate
   - Efficient re-renders

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Profile viewing loads agent data from backend
- [x] Profile displays properties from backend
- [x] Personal info loads current user data
- [x] Personal info saves name/phone updates
- [x] Avatar upload works with base64 encoding
- [x] Loading states show during async operations
- [x] Error handling displays user-friendly messages
- [x] Success feedback shows after operations
- [x] Email is read-only and cannot be changed
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors

## Next Steps

As mentioned, the enhancement opportunities include:

1. **Real-time Updates** - Add websockets/polling for messages/notifications
2. **Image Optimization** - Implement image caching and lazy loading
3. **Pagination** - Add infinite scroll for property lists
4. **Pull-to-Refresh** - Add pull-to-refresh on data screens
5. **Error Boundaries** - Implement error boundaries for better error recovery
6. **Offline Handling** - Add offline support and sync capabilities
